    <h1>Assalaamu Alaikum!</h1>
    <h2 class="my-name">I’m Umar Bello Tafida</h2>
    <p>I’m a Muslim from Rabah, Sokoto State, Nigeria — passionate about technology, leadership, and building digital tools to help my community.  
    With over 3 years’ experience in web development (HTML, CSS & JavaScript), my dream is to turn ideas into solutions that truly help people.</p>

  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I co-founded Rabah Technician, a small digital startup that aimed to bring technology services to rural communities.  
    Now I’m working to create my own chat platform, which I hope to launch soon, In sha Allahu.  
    I started my journey before I was fully ready, and at first, I faced many challenges: limited resources and a team that didn’t share the same vision and ambition. But I never regretted trying, because every mistake became a lesson and every failure made me stronger.</p>
    <blockquote>"Every failure teaches me something. Every mistake is a lesson that gives me experience and encourages me to create something new. Nothing in life is easy, nothing is free — but if you keep moving, nothing is impossible."</blockquote>

  <section id="vision">
    <h2>My Vision</h2>
    <p>My vision goes beyond building tech hubs in Northern Nigeria — I dream of helping my community and Africa at large to survive and thrive in the era of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).  
    Like when electricity first arrived, people feared it would replace jobs — but it actually created more. Today, AI and AGI can do the same if we learn to be creative, innovative, and constructive.  
    I want to use technology to empower youth, improve agriculture, create new opportunities, and make sure no one is left behind in the digital revolution.</p>
