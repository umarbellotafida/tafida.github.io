  <h2 class="my-name">I’m Umar Bello Tafida, CCNA</h2>
  <p>I’m a Muslim from Rabah, Sokoto State, Nigeria — passionate about technology, leadership, and building digital tools to help my community.  
  With over 3 years’ experience in web development (HTML, CSS & JavaScript), my dream is to turn ideas into solutions that truly help people.</p>
</section>

<section id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Umar Bello Tafida. I come from Rabah, Sokoto State, Nigeria — a place that shaped my values, resilience, and deep love for community.  
    From an early age, I’ve been fascinated by how technology can make life easier, open doors to learning, and create opportunities for people who might otherwise be left behind.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the years, I co-founded Rabah Technician, a small initiative that aimed to bring digital services closer to rural areas. Though it faced challenges, it taught me priceless lessons in teamwork, entrepreneurship, and understanding what real people truly need.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, I’m working on building my own chat platform — a tool designed not just for chatting, but for connecting hearts and minds across distances. My goal isn’t just to “write code,” but to create tools that speak the language of the people who use them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond coding, I enjoy mentoring younger students, sharing what I learn, and showing that technology isn’t only for those in big cities. Every project, every failure, and every small success adds another brick to the bigger dream I carry: helping my community step confidently into the digital future.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “Every failure teaches me something. Every mistake is a lesson that gives me experience and encourages me to create something new.”

  <h2>Technical & Educational Background</h2>
  <p>
    My path into technology started with curiosity and a simple wish: to understand how things work behind the screen.
    After finishing my National Diploma in Computer Science at Umaru Ali Shinkafi Polytechnic Sokoto, I kept pushing forward, and I'm now studying Information Technology at Sokoto State University.
  </p>
  <p>
    Along the way, I spent over 3 years learning and building with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — turning lines of code into something real and useful.
    I also trained in Cisco Networking and Cybersecurity, giving me a solid foundation in network design, secure systems, and protecting data.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2019, I completed my Diploma in Certified Information Security System Professional (CISSP) on Alison, where I proudly graduated with an A grade. Beyond formal education, I believe in lifelong learning: I've completed online courses, built personal projects, and co-founded <strong>Rabah Technician</strong> to bring digital payment services to rural communities.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>National Diploma in Computer Science</li>
    <li>Currently studying Information Technology (BSc)</li>
    <li>Diploma in Certified Information Security System Professional – 2019 (A grade, Alison)</li>
    <li>3+ years of web development experience</li>
    <li>Cisco Networking & Cybersecurity training</li>
    <li>Practical projects in web, digital tools & community services</li>
  </ul>

<section id="leadership">
  <h2>Leadership Experience</h2>
  <p>
    Leadership for me has always been about service — lifting others, listening deeply, and making sure everyone’s voice is heard.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>As <strong>Financial Secretary of the SUG</strong>, I learned transparency and accountability — keeping finances clear and supporting fair projects.</li>
    <li>Serving as <strong>President of Rabah Local Govt Students Association</strong> taught me how to unite people from different backgrounds under shared goals.</li>
    <li>As <strong>Speaker of the Students Representative Assembly (SRA)</strong>, I refined my skills in negotiation, debate, and standing up for what students needed most.</li>
    <li>Later, becoming <strong>National President of Federated Organisation Of Rabah and Wurno Students (FORWS)</strong> and <strong>PRO of National All Comrade Congress (Northwest)</strong> gave me a bigger platform to advocate for youth development, digital inclusion, and education.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Each role added new lessons, deepened my sense of responsibility, and strengthened my belief that real leadership starts with humility and ends with empowering others.
  </p>

<section id="vision">
  <h2>My Vision</h2>
  <p>
    I believe Africa, and especially places like Sokoto, deserve to benefit from the same breakthroughs transforming the rest of the world.  
    My vision is to help my community and beyond embrace the era of AI, AGI, and digital tools — not just as users, but as creators.
  </p>
  <p>
    I dream of building local tech hubs that train young people, mentor them, and give them real, practical skills. Imagine young people here designing smart solutions for farming, health care, or education that truly fit our local context.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s not about big titles or shiny apps — it’s about using what I know to open doors for others, so that the next generation can build, innovate, and lead with confidence.
  </p>
